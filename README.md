# New-CRA

New `create-react-app`

If you want to create a new app named `my-app` then use the command below.

```bash
npx new-cra my-app
```

After the installation has finished

```bash
cd my-app
npm start
```

You can use a different name other than `my-app` if you wish. Just use that other name in place of `my-app` in the above commands.

## Updating `new-cra`

`new-cra` is occasionally updated, to ensure you are using the latest version of `new-cra`, then run,

```bash
npx new-cra@latest my-app
```

## Typescript

You can create a TypeScript React project by adding the `-ts` flag.

```bash
npx new-cra@latest my-app -ts
```

## About

New-CRA (New Create-React-APP) will build a basic React template for you.

It uses [R3F-Pack](https://github.com/Sean-Bradley/R3F-Pack) under the hood to build your production and development code.

As long as you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your computer, you should then be able to just open a command prompt and type,

```bash
npx new-cra my-app
```

And it will create a new basic React template/starter/boilerplate that you can start developing your new application from.

Happy Hacking!

Sean
