# New-CRA

New `create-react-app`

If you want to create a new app named `my-app` then use the command below.

```bash
npx new-cra my-app
```

After the command has finished

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm start
```

You can use a different name other than `my-app` if you wish. Just use that other name in place of `my-app` in the above commands.

## Updating `new-cra`

To ensure you have the latest version of `new-cra` run,

```bash
npx new-cra@latest my-app
```
